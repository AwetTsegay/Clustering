# Clustering

We will focus on unsupervised learning. We will discuss clustering, which briefly means we want to group similar observations in a dataset, in order to understand the structure of the data. The topics in this week include:

1. Differences between supervised and unsupervised learning
2. Why are we interested in clustering?
3. K-Means algorithm
4. Hierarchical Clustering (HC), and 
5. Agglomerative HC algorithm
